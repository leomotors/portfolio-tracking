# Portfolio Tracking

Tracking my investments.

## Project Structure

### apps

- cron: Scheduled tasks for updating price, calculate balances and insert database records.

### packages

- database: Database schema with Drizzle ORM on PostgreSQL.

## Linting

Linting is done by ESLint and formatting is done by prettier. No need to do anything to fix format or import sort order, human will run script to fix them manually.
